              <h2 class="about-header">Brief History</h2>
              <p>CEO Anne Holton enjoyed taking her small fishing boat out on Lake Erie each summer. One day, the waters were too rough to stay on the lake, so she and her father, Gary, decided to take the boat up the Cuyahoga River. Power-boating through the Cleveland waterways, Anne used her smart phone to research old signs on buildings under construction along their route. She and Gary learned fun new facts about former Cleveland businesses, and the idea for Orbeas Rogue was born.</p>
